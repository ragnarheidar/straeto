# Strætó

A leaflet map showing walkable distance from a set of bus stops in the capital area of Reykjavik, Iceland. This map was crated as an input to proposed changes to the bus network where distance from bus stops was calculated as a fixed radius rather than the estimated walkable distance.

This is a map that compares linear distance to walkable distance for a given bus stop. This distance picked in this instance is 400 meters.

The map is available as a GitHub Page [here](https://ragnarheidar.github.io/straeto/).
